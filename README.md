This is Pipe Fantasy! The game is a rendition of the <a href=https://classicreload.com/win3x-pipe-dream-1991.html>Pipe Dream</a> Game! This a simplified version of the game which still allows you to place randomly generated Pipes on the board in order to try to get the "goo", shown through green pipes in gif, to flow! Enjoy the game and the higher the score, the better.
